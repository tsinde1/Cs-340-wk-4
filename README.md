This Python CRUD  module we are working uses MySQL database to store data and  enables the users to create,read,update and delete data from the database. The user authentication extension used is the Flask-Login extension. THe module enables its users to create ,read, update and delete data into the text fields provided and also by clicking the submit button. The user will be able to view the data by clicking on the view button and will be able to update the data by clicking on the update button. The user will then delete data by clicking the delete button. 

The main tools that have been used for our project are Flask web framework, the Flask login extension and MySQL database together with the Python programming laguage.
